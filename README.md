# Boolean-Function-NI-LABVIEW
Explanation of Boolean functions in NI LABVIEW with examples.
AND,OR,XOR:
     These are logic gates which has 2 inputs.Input should be in Boolean data type (i.e. T or F).
NOT:
     It is a logic gate with 1 boolean input.It just invert the input.
NOT AND,NOT OR,NOT XOR:
     These are logic gates  which is a combo of NOT gate with AND or OR or XOR.It just invert the output of AND or OR or XOR gate.
IMPLIES:
     It is a function which has 2 inputs.It negates the first input and then compute logical OR function of second input with negated
     first input.
COMPOUND ARITHMETIC:
     It is a function which has 5 sub function such ADD,MUL,AND,OR,XOR.Array of boolean data is given as input.All the data in the array is 
     operated with the corresponding operation.
AND & OR ARRAY ELEMENTS:
     Array of boolean data is given as input,all the data in array is operated with corresponding operation.
NUMBER TO ARRAY (or) vice versa:
     If we give a numeric number,this function convert the number to boolean data in an array format with the help of LED lights (or)
     vice versa.
BOOLEAN TO (0,1):
     It is a function which converts boolean data to binary data (i.e.) True=1 ,False=0.

Here is the example of each boolean function explained above with its output.
